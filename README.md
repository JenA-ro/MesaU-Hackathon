The program finds the food banks closest to the user’s city, helping low income families with food insecurities.
It is easily accessible and user friendly because our program provides step by step, direct instructions (top to bottom). 
It’s especially accessible to those inexperienced with technology, like elderly people. 
The websites for the food banks results are legitimate because we fact checked it, so the user won’t have to worry about the food bank
not being an actual food bank but a thrift store for example. The program is also accessible to those who do not speak English, but Spanish.

The people who helped make this program are: Shreya Bunga, Jennier Enerio, Oscar Vasquwz, Francisco Valencia.
